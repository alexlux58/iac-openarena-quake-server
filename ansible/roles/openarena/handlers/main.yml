# Ansible Handlers
# Handlers are tasks that run only when notified by other tasks
# They are useful for restarting services when configuration changes

# Reload systemd daemon
# This is needed after creating/modifying systemd service files
# changed_when: false prevents this from showing as "changed" in playbook output
- name: Reload systemd
  ansible.builtin.command: systemctl daemon-reload
  changed_when: false

# Restart OpenArena service
# This handler is triggered when server.cfg or the systemd unit file changes
- name: Restart OpenArena
  ansible.builtin.systemd:
    name: openarena
    state: restarted
